## Objectives
**The system should:**
* Dynamically call route both inbound and outbound calls to match end-customers (or potential customers) according to RMs skills and customer profiles.
* Adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM).
* Dial outbound calls automatically, display customer details and guideline script, matching RMs skills and target customer profiles.
* Produce skill scores of RMs based on previous call durations, sales and profile.
* Direct inbound customers to an interactive voice response which will prompt with options and ask for the purpose of their call, then redirecting the call to an automatic call distributor to route the call to an RM.
* Allow customers to purchase holiday packages over the phone.
* Provide purchased holiday package receipts to customer (which have been purchased over the phone).

**Problem Statement:** The business processes of the major travel companies call management centre should automate the routing of calls to reduce wait times for connecting with a RM, aid their booking of holiday packages and promote efficiency within the business.

 * Be matched with customers who I will be most effective in selling products to based on my product as well as social and cultural knowledge.
