## Objectives
**The system should:**
* Adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RMs) by:
  * Filtering customers based on likelihood of purchase
  * Matching customers based on performance and product knowledge of RMs, for example, in selling particular travel packages, the system would do well in matching end-customers to well informed RMs with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its traditions.
  * Matching skills and customer profiles into social and cultural segments according to their postcode and surname.
  * Producing skill scores of RMs based on previous call durations, sales and profile
* Direct inbound customers to an interactive voice response which will prompt with options and ask for the purpose of their call, then redirecting the call to an automatic call distributor to route the call to an RM
* Allow customers to purchase holiday packages over the phone
* Generate receipts of holiday packages which have been purchased over the phone

**Problem Statement:** The business processes of the major travel companies call management centre should automate the routing of calls to reduce wait times for connecting with a RM, aid their booking of holiday packages and promote efficiency within the business.
