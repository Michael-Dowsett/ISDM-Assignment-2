# University of Technology, Sydney:  IS Development Methodologies – 31257 Autumn 2020 (Project – 50%)

## Problem Definition

### Objectives

A major travel company has tasked us to develop an information system to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC).

The system will dynamically match and assign inbound and outbound customer calls to Relationship Managers (RM) according to skills and profiles. A customer profile will be automatically made using the Profiler Tool and RM profile is initialised at hiring. RM profiles will adjust according to RMs performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently.

The system dials outbound calls automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system. This list consists of tuples of information in the form of *<potential customer, product proposed>* and it is provided to a specific RM. The system retrieves the customer details from the database and provides the RM guidelines and a script to help provide improved service to the end customer.

Inbound customer calls contacts the CMC which has its own private branch exchange to route calls. A customer will get a score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product (e.g. repeat customers may have a higher score, customers from particular postcodes may have lower scores, etc...). A customer with higher scores is served first. A skill score is allocated to a RM based on their previous call duration and profile.

During busy times a customer is directed to an interactive voice response unit promoting them for options. It may ask a few questions before redirecting the customer to the automatic call distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM.

### Assumptions

* Approved project budget will not change.
* Approved project scope will not change.
* The project will follow an agile methodology.
* Accuracy of stored customer information (e.g. age, sex, language, ethnicity).
* Interactive Voice Response unit caters for customer accessibility requirements.
* Interactive voice response unit has good voice recognition and can have users list words that respond with their call
* Technical infrastructure is managed by the Travel Company (including call numbers).
* Training for the new CMC system will be internally managed.
* RMs successfully use sales techniques to sell holiday packages.
* RMs are unable to see their own profile scores.
* Existing scored customers will be prioritised over new customers.
* The travel company does not have an online website for their customers to find holiday packages.
* The travel company has found the benefits of matching customer and RM profiles.
* RM profiles will be initialised at hiring, existing RMs will be required to complete Profiling Tool questionnaire.
* Outbound calls are made on accurate information stored in a database, which will include information of sex, age, packages interested, interested location.
* Call data will be logged (e.g. time, duration).
* RM are able to see caller demographics/data on their screen automatically as they receive call
* RMs will be able to manually redirect calls to without negatively impacting their skill score.
* Customers profiles are made using the Profiler Tool.
* Customer profile includes information such as; age, sex, culture, language proficiency, address, sale success rating, phone number(s).
* Relationship managers profile include information such as; age, sex, culture, language proficiency, address, product knowledge, experience, skill score rating, phone number(s), employee ID, profile image.
* Customer sale success rating is based on; purchase history and sale potential.
* Relationship managers skill score rating is based on; previous call duration and similarities between RMs profile and customers profile.
* Call Centres will be staffed around the world and re-routing systems will ensure calls will be answered 24/7.
* CMC system will be used in conjunction with existing systems.
* CMC system has a call recording system.
* RMs profile is automatically updated with every customer they deal with.

### List of Stakeholders

The project has a series of stakeholders including:

| Stakeholder | Explanation |
| - | - |
| Relationship managers | Travel company employees. Will use the system to automate their calls and sell holiday packages. |
| Travel company | The travel company is the client requesting the design and development of the CRM system. As the client, the travel company directly influences the system through timeline, scope, budget and business decisions resulting in the final system. |
| Potential / End-customers | Customers of the travel company will interact with the system when they call the company for travel advice which can be moderated to assign the call to the appropriate RM. |
| Travel company management | The managers of the travel company will use the system to produce financial and performance reports. |

### Point of View (POV) Statements

POV defines the problem to solve in the ideation phase in the Design Thinking process. A focused POV will assist in generating a greater quantity of quality solutions, focused on our users, their needs, and our insights about them during ideation. Forming a POV Madlib in the following sentence: [User . . . (descriptive)] needs [Need . . . (verb)] because [Insight . . . (compelling)] creates an actionable problem statement.

| User | Need | Insight |
|-|-|-|
| RMs who perform sales of holiday packages | To be matched with customers according to their profile and skills | RMs want to be matched with customers based on their profiles due to the increased chance of a sale |
| RMs who are outbound calling | A system to automatically dial and generate a customer target list, displays the customer details and provides the RM with guidelines and a script | RMs want to call potential customers who have an increased chance of purchasing from them based on their profiles |
| RM recruits | Initial profiling (using the Profiler Tool) to build a profile and skill matrix | This initial profile will adjust according to RM performance and match RMs with suitable customers so they can serve customers effectively and efficiently |
| RMs who are outbound calling | Customer details, guidelines and a script | To improve service to the end-customer, the RMs will be matched based on profiles and given appropriate and assistive sales information |
| Travel Company Management| To use CMC software to produce sales reports | Management utilise reports to see operational performance and can respond appropriately to potential issues |
| Customer who want to purchase a holiday package through the CMC | To be matched according to RM skills and customer profile |Customers want to be matched to RMs based on their profiles. RMs are more convincing to a customer if they match social and cultural attributes |
| Travel company | An information system to improve the operation (call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls) of their in-house CMC | The information system will provide assistance to RMs in serving their end-customers (or potential customers) and will match RMs and customers according to RMs skills and customers profiles |
| Customers who are likely to purchase a holiday package | To be prioritised and served by an RM based on skill and profile match | Scoring customers will ensure that likely customers will receive the best customer experience |
| Customers experiencing long wait times | An Interactive Voice Response unit prompting them for information and redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor which will route the call to the first available appropriate RM | Customers experiencing long hold times are likely to hang up - keeping customers engaged is important. The more information available to the RM (and CMC system) enables them to skillfully sell the product |
